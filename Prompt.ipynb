      "The Agni V is an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) developed by the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) of India. It is the fifth missile in the Agni series and is considered to be India's most advanced long-range missile system. Here are some key details about the Agni V missile:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Range: The Agni V has a range of over 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), which makes it an intercontinental ballistic missile. It can reach targets in Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Payload Capacity: The missile has the capability to carry a payload of around 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds), which can include both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Three-Stage Missile: The Agni V is a three-stage solid-fueled missile. It uses advanced technologies like composite rocket motors, micro-navigation systems, and ring laser gyroscopes for accurate guidance and control.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Mobility: The missile is road-mobile, which means it can be transported and launched from various locations. This mobility enhances its survivability and makes it difficult for adversaries to target.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Strategic Deterrence: The Agni V is primarily designed for strategic deterrence, meaning it serves as a deterrent against potential adversaries. It provides India with the capability to strike targets deep inside enemy territory, thus acting as a deterrent against aggression.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Multiple Re-entry Vehicle (MRV) Capability: The Agni V has the ability to carry multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). This means that a single missile can carry multiple warheads, each capable of hitting different targets independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Successful Test Flights: The Agni V has undergone several successful test flights since its first launch in 2012. These tests have demonstrated the missile's range, accuracy, and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Strategic Significance: The development and deployment of the Agni V missile have significant strategic implications for India. It enhances India's deterrence posture, strengthens its national security, and provides a credible response capability in the event of a potential threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the Agni V missile is primarily a defensive weapon system and is developed in accordance with India's \"No First Use\" policy, which means it will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack.\n"
